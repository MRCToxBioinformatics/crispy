This file documents the pooled sorted CRISPR screens to date and which samples passed QC according to Tom and Roberto Campalastri.

Currently, the input files that passed QC for all screens can be found in `input` subdirectores in the directories in `rds/rds-mrc_tox-XUr6B1Jhndg/tss38_09_CRISPR_da442_ap2260/pipeline_runs`.
These files are listed below for each screen

**POLIII - HAP1**
The following samples from the first run (GW2) could not be used:
HAP1_LIB2_R2
POL3_HS_LOW2
POL3_HS_HIGH2
The following samples from the repeat run (GW5) can be used in their place:
POL3_HS_LOW2
POL3_HS_HIGH2
